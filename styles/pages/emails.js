      <blockquote>
        If you don&apos;t already have one, please contact me
        through your current email at <code>moi@knutsen.co</code> to
        set one up, then follow the instructions below.

      <p>
        Since this is on a private server, setup will be a little
        different from other email services.
      </p>

      <p>
        A suggested email client is Mozilla&apos;s&nbsp;
        <a href="https://www.thunderbird.net/">Thunderbird</a> due to it&apos;s
        auto-configuration functionality. However, in all likelihood you&apos;ll
        want to try to stick with whatever email client you use now. Gmail&apos;s
        phone app mail-client works very well with external email on smartphones,
        but not the browser-based Gmail client. For computers I recommended getting
        a proper email-client that can handle any mail, like Thunderbird.

      <h3>General instructions</h3>
      Setting up with email over <b>SSL/TLS</b> (Secure):
      <br/>
      It is very important to use the server URLs provided below when setting
      up the email client, don&apos;t let it say <q>knutsen.co</q>.

      <p><q>IMAP</q> is the recommended protocol.</p>
